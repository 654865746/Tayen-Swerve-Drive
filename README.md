A high performance swerve drive system utilizing brushed 555 motors, absolute encoders, and a teensy 4.1. 

Uses in wheel motors and a slip ring to transmit electrical power without binding/twisting the wires.

Fully holonomic with full inverse kinematics.

Uses cytron motor controllers for the steering motors, and standard pwm input ESCs with linear throttling for the drive motors.

Utilizes the MT6835 Magnetic Encoder Module over SPI bus.
